# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification incorporates the MNIST data set which is a large database of hand-written digits that is commonly used for training 
various image processing systems.
The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. 
It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples together with a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to learn about various pattern recognition methods for real-world data while spending minimal efforts on pre-processing and formatting.
